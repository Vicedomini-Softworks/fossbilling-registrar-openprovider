[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Vicedomini-Softworks/fossbilling-registrar-openprovider/tests.yml?branch=main&label=tests)](https://github.com/Vicedomini-Softworks/fossbilling-registrar-openprovider/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This project integrates the OpenProvider domain registrar with FOSSBilling, enabling users to manage domain registration, transfer, and renewal directly from their FOSSBilling platform.

---

## Features

- **Domain Registration**: Register new domains using OpenProvider's API.
- **Domain Transfer**: Transfer existing domains to OpenProvider from FOSSBilling.
- **Domain Management**: Update DNS, WHOIS, and other settings directly.
- **Renewals**: Automate domain renewals through OpenProvider.

---

## Requirements

- **FOSSBilling**: Make sure you have FOSSBilling installed and properly configured.
- **OpenProvider Account**: An active account with OpenProvider is required to use their API.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and copy the files to the root of your FOSSBilling installation:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vicedomini-Softworks/fossbilling-registrar-openprovider.git
   ```
1. Navigate to the FOSSBilling admin panel.

1. Go to System > Domain registration > New domain registrar and enable the OpenProvider module.

1. Refresh the page, go to the Registrars tab and edit the OpenProvider settings

1. Enter your OpenProvider API credentials:
   - API URL: Live https://api.openprovider.eu (Sandbox http://api.sandbox.openprovider.nl:8480)
   - Username
   - Password
1. Save your configuration.

## Usage

1. Add OpenProvider as your registrar for specific TLDs in FOSSBilling.

1. Clients can register, transfer, or renew domains through your billing system, and the integration will communicate with OpenProvider's API to process requests.

1. Monitor and manage domain actions directly from your FOSSBilling admin panel.

## Troubleshooting
